## üö® Emergency! My Coffee Mug Is Not Connected to GitHub Actions ‚òïÔ∏èü§ñ

Hello Devs,

I am raising this issue with the utmost seriousness and a hint of caffeine withdrawal. It has come to my attention that, despite all our automation wizardry, my coffee mug is still **not integrated with our GitHub Actions workflows**. This is a critical blocker for productivity, morale, and possibly the space-time continuum.

### ‚òïÔ∏è The Problem

Every time I merge a pull request, I expect my coffee mug to fill itself with fresh, hot coffee. Instead, nothing happens. My mug remains empty, my soul grows weary, and my code quality plummets faster than my caffeine levels.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Brew a cup of coffee (manually, like a caveman).
2. Push a commit to the repo.
3. Wait for GitHub Actions to run.
4. Stare at your mug.  
5. Realize it‚Äôs still empty.  
6. Cry softly.

#### Expected Behavior

Upon successful CI/CD pipeline completion, my mug should be filled with the beverage of my choice (preferably Colombian roast, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions).

#### Actual Behavior

Mug remains empty. Developer remains sad. Productivity charts look like a ski slope.

#### Possible Causes

- Lack of IoT-enabled beverage containers.
- GitHub Actions does not support the `brew-coffee` action (yet).
- Coffee beans unionized and are on strike.
- The codebase is haunted by the ghost of decaf.

#### Suggested Solutions

- Develop a custom `actions/coffee-brew@v1` workflow.
- Integrate with the ‚ÄúInternet of Coffee Things‚Äù API.
- Bribe the coffee beans with chocolate.
- Add a `COFFEE_MUG_TOKEN` secret to repo settings.

#### Additional Context

I tried yelling ‚ÄúHey GitHub, make me coffee!‚Äù but my laptop just started updating Windows.  
I also tried sacrificing a donut to the CI gods, but now I‚Äôm just out of donuts.

**P.S.**  
If anyone has a spare IoT coffee mug, please assign yourself to this issue.  
If not, I‚Äôll settle for a working `brew install coffee` command.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. My hands are shaking.
