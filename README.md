# SQL Server automation with PowerShell, dbatools and GitHub Actions

## Session Goals

- Understanding of what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used for database automation
- dbatools examples for SQL Server automation
- attendees will have ideas for their own automation projects

## Abstract

This talk demonstrates how GitHub Actions can be leveraged with PowerShell and SQL Server to streamline database operations and implement DevOps practices for your database environment.

What you'll learn:

- GitHub Actions – This powerful CI/CD platform enables automation triggered by code commits, issue creation and more.
- PowerShell and dbatools – We'll then add PowerShell and dbatools into the mix to extend the automation to managing SQL Server automation.
- Demos and Ideas – I'll show multiple demos, including adding articles to SQL Server replication and deploying database change with sqlpackage.

This session aims to give you a practical understanding of how to combine these technologies to reduce manual effort, minimize human error, and build more reliable and repeatable processes for your SQL Server environments.
