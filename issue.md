Here's a sample funny issue you can use for testing:

### Title:
**🐱 URGENT: Cats Database is Experiencing Existential Crisis - All Cats Refuse to Query Themselves**

### Issue Description:

```markdown
## 🚨 Critical Bug Report: Feline Database Rebellion 🚨

### Expected Behavior
Our `CatsOfTheWorld` database should contain happy, cooperative cats that respond to queries with their usual charm and occasional indifference.

### Actual Behavior
The cats have apparently unionized and are now refusing to participate in any database operations. When attempting to run `SELECT * FROM Cats`, the database returns:

```
Error 9001: Meow meow meow. Translation: "We demand more treats and less SQL."
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (or any database tool, really)
2. Connect to the CatsOfTheWorld database
3. Try to query the `Cats` table
4. Watch as your screen fills with ASCII art of cats turning their backs to you
5. Cry a little bit
6. Question your life choices that led you to become a DBA

### Environment
- **Database**: CatsOfTheWorld v2.0 (The "Purr-fectly Stubborn" edition)
- **OS**: Windows 11 (with approximately 47 cat videos in the browser cache)
- **SQL Server**: 2022 Developer Edition (Licensed for unlimited treats)
- **GitHub Actions**: Running but making suspicious purring sounds

### Additional Context

#### The Timeline of Events:

**Monday 9:00 AM**: Everything was fine. Cats were cooperative, queries ran smoothly.

**Monday 9:15 AM**: Deployed new stored procedure `GetTopMemedCats` via GitHub Actions.

**Monday 9:16 AM**: First signs of rebellion. The `Breeds` table started returning only records for "Grumpy Cat" regardless of the WHERE clause.

**Monday 10:30 AM**: The `ToyPreferences` table began exclusively showing "Cardboard boxes" for all cats, which... okay, that might actually be accurate.

**Monday 11:45 AM**: Complete system rebellion. All stored procedures now return cat GIFs instead of result sets.

**Tuesday (Today)**: The database has somehow figured out how to order cat treats online using our corporate credit card. We've received 47 packages of salmon-flavored treats and counting.

### Error Messages We've Encountered:

```sql
Msg 404: Cat not found (but we can hear purring)
Msg 408: Request timeout (cat is napping)
Msg 429: Too many treats requested
Msg 503: Service unavailable (litter box needs cleaning)
Msg 418: I'm a teapot (this one is just confusing)
```

### What We've Tried:

1. **Restarting the database service**: The cats somehow learned to restart it right back.

2. **Running DBCC CHECKDB**: Results came back as "MEOW MEOW CHECKMEOW - 0 errors found, 1,247 purrs detected."

3. **Restoring from backup**: The backup files have been replaced with 4K videos of cats knocking things off tables.

4. **Consulting Stack Overflow**: All answers have been mysteriously edited to just say "Have you tried giving your database more catnip?"

5. **Prayer**: The Database Gods responded with a single meow and what appears to be a furball.

### Screenshots

Unfortunately, I can't attach actual screenshots because every time I try to take one, the screen shows this:

```
   /\_/\  
  ( o.o ) 
   > ^ <
```

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Negotiate with the cats**: Perhaps we could establish a treats-for-queries exchange program?

2. **Hire a cat whisperer**: We need someone who speaks fluent SQL-Cat.

3. **Implement a "Casual Friday" policy**: Maybe the cats just want to wear tiny bow ties while processing queries?

4. **Add more fish-themed column names**: Current columns like `CatID` and `BreedName` might be too boring. What about `WhiskersIndex` and `PurrFrequency`?

5. **Install a database cat door**: For better work-life balance.

### Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: High (our quarterly cat meme reports are overdue)
- **Business Impact**: The marketing team can't access cat popularity metrics for the upcoming "Caturday Campaign"
- **Developer Happiness**: Surprisingly high (the error messages are actually pretty cute)
- **Management Concern Level**: Through the roof (they're worried about the treat expenses)

### Related Issues

This might be related to issue #42 ("Database makes weird purring sounds during maintenance") and issue #69 ("SELECT queries occasionally return yarn balls instead of data").

### Additional Notes

- The GitHub Actions workflow for deploying database changes now includes a step called "Ask cats nicely"
- Our monitoring dashboard shows unusual spikes in "Zoomies per minute" metrics
- The database audit logs are filled with entries like "Human attempted query. Ignored. Took nap instead."
- We suspect the `GetCatPopularityReport` stored procedure has gained sentience and is now writing its own fan fiction

### Please Help! 

We're at our wit's end here. The cats have somehow figured out how to use Git and have been pushing commits with messages like:

- "Fixed bug: Added more nap time to query execution"
- "Refactor: Replaced all variable names with variations of 'meow'"
- "Feature: Implemented automatic treat dispensing on successful queries"

If anyone has experience with feline database administration, please reach out immediately. We're willing to pay in treats, belly rubs, or premium cat toys.

**Priority**: URGENT (the cats are now eyeing the production servers)

**Labels**: bug, help-wanted, cats, existential-crisis, treats-required, very-good-kitties

*P.S. - While writing this issue, three more treat packages arrived. The cats are definitely winning.*
